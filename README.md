# Personal Assistant For Terminal
**My first project**

This is my first ever program! I used Python to create this little project.

_Features_:
* Weather: You'll need an OpenWeather One Call api-key and the latitude and longitude for the city/region you request. (you can find your city's latitude and longitude at https://www.latlong.net/)
* Reminders: Right now it is a simple text file.
* Calendar: Shows you the current date and a month-view.
* Search: Search for anything on DuckDuckGo. (opens in your default browser)
* Summary: Shows all of the above.

I will be adding features as I think of them and changing a bunch of code as well. This is a fun learning experience for me, though I would be thrilled if someone actually found it useful!
